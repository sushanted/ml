For smaller and smaller values of $\\epsilon$ around L we can provide smaller and smaller values of $\\delta$ around a (except a because f(a) might not be not defined).\n",

    "**For infinitely small $\\epsilon$ the value of f(x) would converge to L and still when limit exist we would be able to provide a $\\delta$ which would be infinitely small and thus x converging to a. We can provide a  𝛿  such that the value of f(x) is limited into the infinitely small epsilon range when value of x is limited into infinitely small delta range: when x converge to a, f(x) converge to L AND this is the well understood limit definition derived from the epsilon-delta definition**\n",

    "For any large $\\epsilon$ we can provide small $\\delta$, by definition f(x) in $\\delta$ range would be always smaller than (or fit in) the $\\epsilon$ range. In other words there is no upper limit on value of $\\epsilon$, as the small $\\delta$ value works for any larger and larger $\\epsilon$ values. In our example, $\\delta$ of 0.0000001 works for $\\epsilon$ values 0.001, 1, 100, 10000000.  \n",
