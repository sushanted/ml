    "Given any point in the input space (x,y), like (3,4) above, there would be a point in the output space (x,y,z); where z = f(x,y). From this point, there would be instantaneous changes (derivatives or slope) towards all the directions (Imagine a point on mountain or inside a vally). How to find the instantaneous changes in any of these directions? We know only two of them, one in the x direction and another in the y direction. Can we use these two to obtain all others?  \n",

    "**Example** : imagine cycling on a uphill road, riding along a straight line parallel to the road needs more efforts. Riding perpeducular to the road is exactly same as riding on a flat surface (piece of a cake!). But our goal is to reach at the highest point, riding perpeducular to road won't get us to there. What if we ride in some angle to the road other than 0 or 90, say 20,30,50 etc in a zig zag manner, we'll require less efforts \n",
    "than riding parallel. Starting from angle 1 till 89, we'll require gradually more and more efforts. Notice we said \"gradually\", **grad**.\n",

    "Again returning to derivatives, for a 2 variable function z = f(x,y), the directional derivative is the change in the value of z with the instantaneous change in x and y. (A good visualization is available here : https://www.geogebra.org/m/Bx8nFMNc , imagine a room with a curved ceiling and walking distance h from a point in a specific direction, the directional derivative is the change in the height of the ceiling w.r.t. h) x and y can change in any proportion, even only x or only y can change leaving y or x un-altered. Therefore direction of change is important here. To get to any direction, we have to change x and y in appropriate proportions so that we land on a point on that direction. h, the instantaneous change, needs to be devided into its x and y components ($h_x$ and $h_y$) so that we can land into the desired direction by moving $h_x$ amount in the x-direction and $h_y$ amount in the y-direction (The vector sum).  \n",

    "We can imagine first moving in x-direction by $h_x$ amount and then in y-direction by $h_y$ amount, finally we'll reach our destination (the desired direction). When we reach x-direction  destination point, one can argue that the derivative in the y-direction at that point could be different than that the original point, but considering $h_x$ very very small, we can consider the derivative same at both the points OR can consider our journey to the destination broken into very very very very small $h_{x1},h_{y1},h_{x2},h_{y2},... $ directions respectively, where $ h_{x1} = \\frac{h_x}{100000000000000...}$     \n",

    "OR (You can ignore this part, but it is interesting, imagine value of $ \\frac{ \\partial z}{ \\partial y} $ at  x = a  and $ x = (a+h_x)$ where $ \\lim_{h_x \\to 0}$ here value of z would be only in terms of y, because x is constant.  \n",
    "e.g. For $ z = 2xy^3 $, $ \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y} = 3xy^2 $. At x=a,$ \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y} = 3ay^2 $ and at $x=(a+h_x)$, $ \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y} = 3(a+h_x)y^2 = 3ay^2 + 3h_xy^2 $. As $ {h_x \\to 0}$ ,$ {3h_xy^2 \\to 0}$ and therefore, $ \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y} \\approx 3ay^2 $.Hence, $ \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y} $ is approximately same at $a$ and $ a+h_x$ )\n",
    "\n",
    "OR (When $\\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y}$ is a continuous function of x, change in $\\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y}$ is limited by the change in $h_x$ by epsilon-delta definition.  \n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. For $ z = 2xy^3$, $ \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y} = 3xy^2 $. If we fix y at constant c. $ \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y} = 3xc^2 $, $ \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y}$ becomes function of only x. If we limit x within a value of delta ($h_x$), value of $f(x) = \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y}$ will be limited within epsilon. When delta ($h_x$) is infinitely small, epsilon i.e. change in $ \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y}$ will also be infinitely small. i.e., for a infinitely small change ($h_x$), there will not be significant change in $ \\frac{\\partial z}{ \\partial y}$.     \n",

This means the angle between the vectors $\\vec\\nabla$ and $\\vec H$ would be 0 to get maximum rate of change. In other words they should point in the same direction, i.e. $\\vec H$ should be a unit vector ($|\\vec H|=1$) in the direction of $\\vec\\nabla$.

    "##### Why magnitude of directional derivative matters:  \n",
    "One very helpful way to think about this is to picture a point in the input space moving with velocity $ \\vec{\\textbf{v}} $\n",
    " The directional derivative of $ f $ along $\\vec{\\textbf{v}} $\n",
    " is the resulting rate of change in the output of the function. So, for example, multiplying the vector $ \\vec{\\textbf{v}} $ by two would double the value of the directional derivative since all changes would be happening twice as fast.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Gradient usefulness:\n",
    " Take a moment to delight in the fact that one single operation, the gradient, packs enough information to compute the rate of change of a function in every possible direction! That's so many directions! Left, right, up, down, north-north-east, $34.8^\\circ $ degrees clockwise from the $x-axis$... Madness!\n",
