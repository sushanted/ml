    "Above video talks about a number line representing 1D vectors drawn onto a 2D space. There would be a transformation from the 2D space to the 1D space represented by the number line. Specifically a 1x2 transformation matrix transforming any vector from 2D space to a 1D vector(or a number) on the number line, which is the projection of the vector in the 2D space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "A unit vector $\\vec{u}$ can be represented in both 2D and 1D space, which is along the number line and which is also a 2D vector in the input 2D space. Now we need to find the 2x1 tranformation matrix which tranforms vectors from the input 2D space into the projection values (Ignore this : $||\\vec{v}||cos\\theta$) in the output 1D space.  \n",
    "\n",
    "To find it, we need to find where the basis vectors land into the output space. These would be two numbers on the number line defining the basis vectors in the output 1D space. By symmetry(refer : https://youtu.be/LyGKycYT2v0?t=535), those would x and y co-ordinates of $\\vec{u}$, say $u_x$ and $u_y$. Therefore the transformation matrix would be $ \\begin{bmatrix} u_x \\ u_y \\end{bmatrix} $, by definition of the transformation.  \n",

    "Now using this matrix we can get projection of any vector $ \\vec{v} = \\begin{bmatrix} x \\\\ y \\end{bmatrix}$ in the input space onto the number line.  \n",
