Shape,size and placement of the parabola depends on the coefficients:

To open the parabola up: (a>0)

$ y = ax^2* bx + c $  

$  = (a)*(x^2)*(1+\frac{\frac{b}{a}}{x}+\frac{\frac{c}{a}}{x^2}) $  

when x tends to infinity, $ (1+\frac{\frac{b}{a}}{x}+\frac{\frac{c}{a}}{x^2}) $ is very close to one (like 0.9999 or 1.0001) depending on sign of a,b and c  

$ x^2 $ is always positive, being a square  

So the value of the equation $ ax^2* bx + c $ totally depends on the sign of a, when x tends to infinity.
