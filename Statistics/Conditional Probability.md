Conditional probability is the probabilty when the sample space is crunched.

Example: In a box there are 5 Green, 10 Red, 20 Blue balls. The general probabilities of a ball randomely : 

P(G) = $\frac{5}{35}$  
P(R) = $\frac{10}{35}$  
P(B) = $\frac{20}{35}$  

Now if we remove all the blue balls from the box and repeat the process, the probabilities would be :

$ P_{NoBlue}(G) = \frac{5}{15} $  
$ P_{NoBlue}(R) = \frac{10}{15} $  

Note that NoBlue is the condition and above probabilities are with the condition.  

Follows some samples to analyze conditional probability and independence:

<b>Cutting a cake: </b> 

Most of the cakes have layers. Say our cake has following layers: Dough: 60%, chocolate:20% and cream:20%. If we cut the cake (the same way we do usually, along x or y axis), The proportion of Dough,chocolate and cream remains exactly same in each piece. If we make the cake half (this is applying the condition) and we consider only left half of the cut cake, the proportion of dough, chocolate and cream remains the same in each half, and hence the probability of each ingradient remains the same as the original cake. Thus cutting the cake along the x or y axis is conditionally independent, the conditional probability after cutting the cake this way remains the same as the original probability.  

Now consider cutting the cake along the z-axis (say, we appointed a Ninja for that with his sharp edged sword). If we cut the cake exectly on half along the z-axis, and now if we consider the upper half, the proportion of ingredients is now completely changed : dough:10%, chocolate:20% and cream:20%, and hence probability is also changed. chocolate and cream now have more probability than the original cake had. Thus cutting the cake along the z axis is a conditionally, the conditional probability after cutting the cake this way is differentthan the original probability.

TODO: Rolling a dice and X < 3 or X < 4
