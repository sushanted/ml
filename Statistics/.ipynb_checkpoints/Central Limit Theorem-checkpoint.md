## Central limit theorem  

The central limit theorem states that if you have a population with mean μ and standard deviation σ and take **sufficiently large** **random** samples from the population **with replacement** , then the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normally distributed.  

Please note bold terms in the above theorem statement.  

### An interpretation:

Whenever we get samples of large sizes from any distribution, the sample becomes a representative of the distribution.

As can be observed from above distributions and samples obtained from them, the sample shapes are very much similar to the original distribution shapes. Wherever there are gaps in original shapes there would be gaps in the samples as well, wherever there are hills, more items can be observed in the samples as well at the same places.  

If sample sizes are increased they become more representative of the original distribution, thus their mean also gets closer to the original distribution mean. For sufficient number of large size samples, the mean of the sample distribution should be very close to the distribution mean.

Taking a random sample 𝑋1,𝑋2,…,𝑋𝑛 from a population with mean 𝜇 and variance 𝜎2 means that the 𝑋𝑖 are independent and that 𝐸(𝑋𝑖)=𝜇 and 𝑉(𝑋𝑖)=𝜎2. All of these random variables have the same variance because they represent observations from the same population.
